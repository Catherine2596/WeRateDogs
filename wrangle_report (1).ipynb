    "7. The various sources that were hidden in the url in the source column were gotten using map and the column was converted to categorical data type.\n",
    "8. Columns such as in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp, expanded_urls, retweet_count, were dropped becaused they will not be used for this analysis.\n",
